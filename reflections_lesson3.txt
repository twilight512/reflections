When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- When sharing projects with other people, or if you need to access the repository from various remote locations or on various different devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- You might not want to introduce new changes or change the location of master all the time.
